# Pebble Netlist for Digistump Oak V1

This circuit includes a 6-pin FTDI header for serial programming the Oak board.  This is only needed
because the Oak did not have a built-in UART interface on the USB connector.

This circuit is wired by hand.  There may be mistakes.  Please check your results against the code carefully.

To use view or modify this netlist, load it into the PEBBLE Picaxe Electronic Bread Board Layout Emulator.
You can find this online in several places to run locally or on the web.

The one I used is here: [PEBBLE v3.1](http://pebble.my-board.org/P_for_FF.html)
